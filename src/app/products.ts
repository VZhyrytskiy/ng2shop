    description: 'The Russian Blue is gentle, quiet and even shy around strangers, but she’s affectionate and loyal toward her people. She’ll follow you around and even ride on your shoulder./n     She can entertain herself while home alone but loves to play games of fetch with her people. You may also find her jumping and climbing so she can observe everything from above. If you need an alarm clock, this feline relies on routine and will wake you each morning so she doesn’t miss breakfast. She’s tolerant of children and other cat-friendly pets.'

    description: 'Seal point, chocolate point, blue point, lilac point. Siamese Cats are incredibly social, intelligent and vocal—they’ll talk to anyone who wants to listen, and even those who don’t. They also play well with other cats, dogs and children. In fact, they thrive on companionship, so it’s a good idea to get them a playmate to interact with throughout the day. Although they’re active and curious, they also love curling up on their human’s lap or snuggling up next to them in bed.'
